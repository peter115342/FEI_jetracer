# Bachelor Thesis: Autonomous Robotic Vehicle with Object Detection

This repository hosts the documentation and related materials for my bachelor thesis titled "Autonomous Robotic Vehicle with Object Detection and Classification on the Jetson Platform."

The primary goal of this thesis was to assemble the hardware and implement the software for an autonomous robotic vehicle. This vehicle, powered by a Jetson Nano single-board computer, is designed to navigate a pre-mapped environment and identify predefined objects using its camera system and object detection algorithms. Additionally, the project includes a remote control station for monitoring the vehicle's camera feed, and allowing for manual control.

## ðŸ“– Documentation

The complete documentation for this project, including setup, usage, and development details, is available at:
**[https://peter115342.github.io/FEI_jetracer/](https://peter115342.github.io/FEI_jetracer/)**

This documentation is built using Github Actions from the `fei-jetracer-docs` directory in this repository.

## ðŸš— FEIcar Submodule

This repository includes `FEIcar` as a submodule. `FEIcar` is my customized fork of the Donkeycar platform, tailored for the specific requirements of this thesis.

You can find the `FEIcar` repository here:
